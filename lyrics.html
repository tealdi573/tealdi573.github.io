Are you going to Sacrborough Fair
<br>
Parsely Sage Rosemary and Thyme
<br>
Remember me to one who lives there
<br>
She once was a true love of mine

<br>
<br>
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
<br>
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green).
<br>
Parsely Sage Rosemary and Thyme
<br>
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground).
<br>
Without no seams nor needlework,
<br>
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the 

mountain).
<br>
Then she'll be a ture love of mine.
<br>
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call).

<br>
<br>
Tell her to find me an acre of land
<br>
(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves).
<br>
Parsely Sage, Rosemary and Thyme
<br>
(Washes the grave with silvery tears).
<br>
Between the salt water and sea strand
<br>
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun).
<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine  

<br>
<br>
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
<br>
(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions).
<br>
Parsely Sage Rosemary and Thyme
<br>
(Generals order their soldiers to kill).
<br>
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
<br>
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten).
<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine

<br>
<br>
<p>Are you going to Scarborough Fair
<br>
Parsely Sage Rosemary and Thyme
<br>
Remember me to one who lives there
<br>
She once was a true love of mine.</p>
